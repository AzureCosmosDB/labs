# Authoring Azure Cosmos DB Stored Procedures with Continuation Tokens

In this lab, you will author and execute multiple stored procedures within your Azure Cosmos DB instance. You will explore features unique to JavaScript stored procedures such as throwing errors for transaction rollback, logging using the JavaScript console and implementing a continuation model within a bounded execution environment.

> If this is your first lab and you have not already completed the setup for the lab content see the instructions for [Account Setup](00-account_setup.md) before starting this lab.

## Author Stored Procedures using the Continuation Model

You will now implement stored procedures that may execute longer than the bounded execution limits on the server. You will implement the continuation model so that the stored procedures can "pick up where they left off" after they ran out of time in a previous execution.

### Create Bulk Upload and Bulk Delete Stored Procedures

1. From within the **Cosmos DB** resource blade, select on the **Data Explorer** link on the left

1. Expand the **NutritionDatabase** and then select to select the **FoodCollection**.

1. Select the **New Stored Procedure** button at the top of the **Data Explorer** section.

1. In the stored procedure tab, locate the **Stored Procedure Id** field and enter the value: **bulkUpload**.

1. Replace the contents of the stored procedure editor with the following JavaScript code:

   ```js
   function bulkUpload(docs) {
     var container = getContext().getCollection();
     var containerLink = container.getSelfLink();
     var count = 0;
     if (!docs) throw new Error("The array is undefined or null.");
     var docsLength = docs.length;
     if (docsLength == 0) {
       getContext()
         .getResponse()
         .setBody(0);
       return;
     }
     tryCreate(docs[count], callback);
     function tryCreate(doc, callback) {
       var isAccepted = container.createDocument(containerLink, doc, callback);
       if (!isAccepted)
         getContext()
           .getResponse()
           .setBody(count);
     }
     function callback(err, doc, options) {
       if (err) throw err;
       count++;
       if (count >= docsLength) {
         getContext()
           .getResponse()
           .setBody(count);
       } else {
         tryCreate(docs[count], callback);
       }
     }
   }
   ```

   > This stored procedure uploads an array of documents in one batch. If the entire batch is not completed, the stored procedure will set the response body to the number of documents that were imported. Your client-side code is expected to call this stored procedure multiple times until all documents are imported.

   If you are having trouble copying the stored procedure above, the full source code for this stored procedure is located here: [bulk_upload.js](../solutions/05-authoring_stored_procedures/bulk_upload.js)

1. Select the **Save** button at the top of the tab.

1. Select the **New Stored Procedure** button at the top of the **Data Explorer** section.

1. In the stored procedure tab, locate the **Stored Procedure Id** field and enter the value: **bulkDelete**.

1. Replace the contents of the stored procedure editor with the following JavaScript code:

   ```js
   function bulkDelete(query) {
     var container = getContext().getCollection();
     var containerLink = container.getSelfLink();
     var response = getContext().getResponse();
     var responseBody = {
       deleted: 0,
       continuation: true
     };
     if (!query) throw new Error("The query is undefined or null.");
     tryQueryAndDelete();
     function tryQueryAndDelete(continuation) {
       var requestOptions = { continuation: continuation };
       var isAccepted = container.queryDocuments(
         containerLink,
         query,
         requestOptions,
         function(err, retrievedDocs, responseOptions) {
           if (err) throw err;
           if (retrievedDocs.length > 0) {
             tryDelete(retrievedDocs);
           } else if (responseOptions.continuation) {
             tryQueryAndDelete(responseOptions.continuation);
           } else {
             responseBody.continuation = false;
             response.setBody(responseBody);
           }
         }
       );
       if (!isAccepted) {
         response.setBody(responseBody);
       }
     }
     function tryDelete(documents) {
       if (documents.length > 0) {
         var isAccepted = container.deleteDocument(
           documents[0]._self,
           {},
           function(err, responseOptions) {
             if (err) throw err;
             responseBody.deleted++;
             documents.shift();
             tryDelete(documents);
           }
         );
         if (!isAccepted) {
           response.setBody(responseBody);
         }
       } else {
         tryQueryAndDelete();
       }
     }
   }
   ```

   > This stored procedure iterates through all documents that match a specific query and deletes the documents. If the stored procedure is unable to delete all documents, it will return a continuation token. Your client-side code is expected to repeatedly call the stored procedure passing in a continuation token until the stored procedure does not return a continuation token.

   If you are having trouble copying the stored procedure above, the full source code for this stored procedure is located here: [bulk_delete.js](../solutions/05-authoring_stored_procedures/bulk_delete.js)

1. Select the **Save** button at the top of the tab.

### Create a .NET Core Project

1. On your local machine, locate the CosmosLabs folder in your Documents folder and open the `Lab07` folder that will be used to contain the content of your .NET Core project. If you are completing this lab through Microsoft Hands-on Labs, the CosmosLabs folder will be located at the path: **C:\labs\CosmosLabs**

1. In the `Lab07` folder, right-click the folder and select the **Open with Code** menu option.

   > Alternatively, you can run a terminal in your current directory and execute the `code .` command.

1. In the Visual Studio Code window that appears, right-click the **Explorer** pane and select the **Open in Terminal** menu option.

   ![Open in Terminal](../media/open_in_terminal.jpg)

1. In the terminal pane, enter and execute the following command:

   ```sh
   dotnet restore
   ```

   > This command will restore all packages specified as dependencies in the project.

1. In the terminal pane, enter and execute the following command:

   ```sh
   dotnet build
   ```

   > This command will build the project.

1. In the **Explorer** pane verify that you have a **DataTypes.cs** file in your project folder.

   > This file contains the data classes you will be working with in the following steps.

1. Double-click the **Program.cs** link in the **Explorer** pane to open the file in the editor.

1. For the `_endpointUri` variable, replace the placeholder value with the **URI** value and for the `_primaryKey` variable, replace the placeholder value with the **PRIMARY KEY** value from your Azure Cosmos DB account. Use [these instructions](00-account_setup.md) to get these values if you do not already have them:

   - For example, if your **uri** is `https://cosmosacct.documents.azure.com:443/`, your new variable assignment will look like this: 

    ```csharp
    private static readonly string _endpointUri = "https://cosmosacct.documents.azure.com:443/";
    ```

   - For example, if your **primary key** is `elzirrKCnXlacvh1CRAnQdYVbVLspmYHQyYrhx0PltHi8wn5lHVHFnd1Xm3ad5cn4TUcH4U0MSeHsVykkFPHpQ==`, your new variable assignment will look like this: 

   ```csharp
   private static readonly string _primaryKey = "elzirrKCnXlacvh1CRAnQdYVbVLspmYHQyYrhx0PltHi8wn5lHVHFnd1Xm3ad5cn4TUcH4U0MSeHsVykkFPHpQ==";
   ```

1. Save all of your open editor tabs.

1. In the Visual Studio Code window, right-click the **Explorer** pane and select the **Open in Terminal** menu option.

1. In the open terminal pane, enter and execute the following command:

   ```sh
   dotnet build
   ```

   > This command will build the console project.You'll likely see warnings related to the lack of the `await` operator. You can ignore these for now.

### Execute Bulk Upload Stored Procedure from .NET Core SDK

1. In the Visual Studio Code window, double select to open the **Program.cs** file

1. Locate the **BulkUpload** method within the **Program** class:

   ```csharp
   public static async Task Main(string[] args)
   ```

   > As a reminder, the Bogus library generates a set of test data. In this example, you are creating 10,000 items using the Bogus library and the rules listed. The **Generate** method tells the Bogus library to use the rules to create the specified number of entities and store them in a generic **List<T>**.

1. Below the `.Generate(10000)` statement add the following line of code to create a variable named **pointer** with a default value of **zero**.

   ```csharp
   int pointer = 0;
   ```

   > We are going to use this variable to determine how many documents were uploaded by our stored procedure.

1. Next, add the following **while** block to continue to iterate code as long as the value of the **pointer** field is _less than_ the amount of items in the **foods** collection:

   ```js
   while (pointer < foods.Count)
   {

   }
   ```

   > We are going to create a while loop that will keep uploading documents until the pointer's value greater than or equal to the amount of food objects in our object set.

1. Within the **while** block, add the following lines of code to execute the stored procedure:

   ```csharp
   StoredProcedureExecuteResponse<int> result = await container.Scripts.ExecuteStoredProcedureAsync<int>("bulkUpload", new PartitionKey("Energy Bars"), new dynamic[] {foods.Skip(pointer)});
   ```

   > This line of code will execute the stored procedure using three parameters; the partition key for the data set you are executing against, the name of the stored procedure, and a list of **food** objects to send to the stored procedure.

1. Still within the **while** block, add the following line of code to store the number returned by the stored procedure in the **pointer** variable:

   ```csharp
   pointer += result.Resource;
   ```

   > Every time the stored procedure returns how many documents were processed, we will increment the counter.

1. Still within the **while** block, add the following line of code to print out the amount of documents uploaded in the current iteration:

   ```csharp
   await Console.Out.WriteLineAsync($"{pointer} Total Items\t{result.Resource} Items Uploaded in this Iteration");
   ```

1. Locate the **Main** method and add the following line of code:

   ```csharp
   await BulkUpload(container);
   ```

1. Your **Main** method and **BulkUpload** should now look like this:

   ```csharp
   public static async Task Main(string[] args)
   {
      _client = new CosmosClient(_endpointUri, _primaryKey))

      Database database = _client.GetDatabase(_databaseId);
      Container container = database.GetContainer(_containerId);

      await BulkUpload();
   }

   Private static Task BulkUpload()
   {
      List<Food> foods = new Bogus.Faker<Food>()
      .RuleFor(p => p.Id, f => (-1 - f.IndexGlobal).ToString())
      .RuleFor(p => p.Description, f => f.Commerce.ProductName())
      .RuleFor(p => p.ManufacturerName, f => f.Company.CompanyName())
      .RuleFor(p => p.FoodGroup, f => "Energy Bars")
      .Generate(10000);

      int pointer = 0;
      while (pointer < foods.Count)
      {
            StoredProcedureExecuteResponse<int> result = await container.Scripts.ExecuteStoredProcedureAsync<int>("bulkUpload", new PartitionKey("Energy Bars"), new dynamic[] {foods.Skip(pointer)});
            pointer += result.Resource;
            await Console.Out.WriteLineAsync($"{pointer} Total Items\t{result.Resource} Items Uploaded in this Iteration");
      }
   }
   ```

      - You will notice that our C# code using the **Skip** method of the LINQ library to submit only the subset of our documents that are not yet uploaded.
      - On the first execution of the while loop, we will skip **0** documents and attempt to upload all documents.
      - When the stored procedure has finished executing, we will get a response indicating how many documents were uploaded. As an example, let's say **5000** documents were uploaded.
      - The pointer will now be incremented to a value of **5000**. On the next check of the while loop's condition, **5000** will be evaluated to be less than **25000** causing another execution of the code in the while loop.
      - The LINQ method will now skip **5000** documents and send the remaining **20000** documents to the stored procedure to upload.
      - This loop will continue until all documents are uploaded.

      > Also keep in mind that as of this writing, Cosmos DB has a 2 MB request limit on all calls. If your data is bigger than this test data, consider chaining `.Take()` to `foods.Skip(point)` to send a smaller payload with each request.

1. Press **Ctrl-S** to save the `program.cs` file

> [!NOTE]
> Before running this code, return to the Azure Portal and make sure the FoodCollection container is scaled up to 10,000 RU/s.

1. In the open terminal pane, enter and execute the following command:

   ```sh
   dotnet run
   ```

   > This command will build and execute the console project.

1. Observe the results of the console project.

   > This stored procedure will batch upload 10,000 documents to your collection within the specified partition key.

### Observe the Uploaded Documents in the Azure Portal

1. Return to the **Azure Portal** (<http://portal.azure.com>).

1. On the left side of the portal, select the **Resource groups** link.

1. In the **Resource groups** blade, locate and select the **cosmoslab** _Resource Group_.

1. In the **cosmoslab** blade, select the **Azure Cosmos DB** account you recently created.

1. In the **Azure Cosmos DB** blade, locate and select the **Data Explorer** link on the left side of the blade.

1. In the **Data Explorer** section, expand the **NutritionDatabase** database node and then observe select the **FoodCollection** node.

1. Select the **New SQL Query** button at the top of the **Data Explorer** section.

1. To validate that our documents were uploaded, we will issue a query to select all documents with the partition key we used earlier for the stored procedure's execution. In the query tab, replace the contents of the query editor with the following SQL query:

   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM foods f WHERE f.foodGroup = "Energy Bars"
   ```

1. Select the **Execute Query** button in the query tab to run the query.

1. In the **Results** pane, observe the results of your query.

1. In the query tab, replace the contents of the query editor with the following SQL query:

   ```sql
   SELECT COUNT(1) FROM foods f WHERE f.foodGroup = "Energy Bars"
   ```

   > This query will return a count of the documents that are in the **Energy Bars** partition key.

1. Select the **Execute Query** button in the query tab to run the query.

1. In the **Results** pane, observe the results of your query.

### Execute Bulk Delete Stored Procedure from .NET Core SDK

1. In the Visual Studio Code pane, double select the **Program.cs** file to open it in the editor.

   > The next stored procedure returns a complex JSON object instead of a simple typed value. We use a custom `DeleteStatus` C# class to deserialize the JSON object so we can use its data in our C# code.

1. Locate the **BulkDelete** method and add the following code:

   ```csharp
    private static async Task BulkDelete(Container container)
    {
        bool resume = true;
        do
        {
            string query = "SELECT * FROM foods f WHERE f.foodGroup = 'Energy Bars'";
                StoredProcedureExecuteResponse<DeleteStatus> result = await container.Scripts.ExecuteStoredProcedureAsync<DeleteStatus>("bulkDelete", new PartitionKey("Energy Bars"),  new dynamic[] {query});

            await Console.Out.WriteLineAsync($"Batch Delete Completed.\tDeleted: {result.Resource.Deleted}\tContinue: {result.Resource.Continuation}");
            resume = result.Resource.Continuation;
        }
        while (resume);
    }
   ```

   > This code will execute the stored procedure that deletes documents as long as the **resume** variable is set to true. The stored procedure itself always returns an object, serialized as **DeleteStatus**, that has a boolean indicating whether we should continue deleting documents and a number indicating how many documents were deleted as part of this execution. Within the do-while loop, we simply store the value of the boolean returned from the stored procedure in our **resume** variable and continue executing the stored procedure until it returns a false value indicating that all documents were deleted.

1. Locate the **Main** method and comment out `await BulkUpdate(container)` and call the `BulkDelete` method. The method should look like this:

   ```csharp
    public static async Task Main(string[] args)
    {
        _client = new CosmosClient(_endpointUri, _primaryKey);

        Database database = _client.GetDatabase(_databaseId);
        Container container = database.GetContainer(_containerId);

        //await BulkUpload(container);
        await BulkDelete(container);
    }
   ```

1. Save all of your open editor tabs.

1. In the Visual Studio Code window, right-click the **Explorer** pane and select the **Open in Terminal** menu option.

1. In the open terminal pane, enter and execute the following command:

   ```sh
   dotnet run
   ```

   > This command will build and execute the console project.

1. Observe the results of the console project.

   > This stored procedure will delete all of the documents associated with the specified partition key. In this demo, this means we will delete the documents we batch uploaded earlier.

1. Close all open editor tabs.

### Query for Documents Within a Partition Key in the Azure Portal

1. Return to the **Azure Portal** (<http://portal.azure.com>).

1. On the left side of the portal, select the **Resource groups** link.

1. In the **Resource groups** blade, locate and select the **cosmoslab** _Resource Group_.

1. In the **cosmoslab** blade, select the **Azure Cosmos DB** account you recently created.

1. In the **Azure Cosmos DB** blade, locate and select the **Data Explorer** link on the left side of the blade.

1. In the **Data Explorer** section, expand the **NutritionDatabase** database node and then observe select the **FoodCollection** node.

1. Select the **New SQL Query** button at the top of the **Data Explorer** section.

1. In the query tab, replace the contents of the query editor with the following SQL query:

   ```sql
   SELECT COUNT(1) FROM foods f WHERE f.foodGroup = "Energy Bars"
   ```

   > This query will return a count of the documents that are in the **Energy Bars** partition key. This count should verify that all documents were deleted.

1. Select the **Execute Query** button in the query tab to run the query.

1. In the **Results** pane, observe the results of your query.
